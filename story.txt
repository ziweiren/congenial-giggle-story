Bob Gump looked at the stripy ruler in his hands and felt lonely.
He walked over to the window and reflected on his damp surroundings. 
He had always loved beautiful Camborne with its uncooked, ugliest umbrellas.
It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel lonely.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. 
It was the figure of Maureen Plumb. 
Maureen was a snooty juggler with dirty fingernails and solid arms.




One afternoon a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from over a lofty branch.

"Just the thing to quench my thirst," he thought.

Taking a few steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. 
Again the fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them but still failed.
Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said,
 
"They're probably sour anyway," and proceeded to walk away.

How are you going today?
