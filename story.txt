Bob Gump looked at the stripy ruler in his hands and felt lonely.
He walked over to the window and reflected on his damp surroundings. 
He had always loved beautiful Camborne with its uncooked, ugliest umbrellas.
It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel lonely.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. 
It was the figure of Maureen Plumb. 
Maureen was a snooty juggler with dirty fingernails and solid arms.
